### Documentation requirements using DockerHub
- Create `README.md` in main folder of your repo that details the following:
    - Project Overview
      - This project is usuing Docker to host a public repository that is running in a container all within Git workflows  
    - Run Project Locally  
        - how you installed docker + dependencies (WSL2, for example)  
          - Install docker desktop via: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop  
          - Install docker on linux    
          - Create public Docker repo by creating an account and hitting the create repo button and setting it to public    
            
        - how to build the container
          - Once you .json file is available you can do something like this ` docker build -t getting-started .`    
        - how to run the container    
          - ` docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started` be sure to run on the port that you desire     
        - how to view the project (open a browser...go to ip and port...)   
          -  Go to a browser and search to 127.0.0.1 (home) with a colon to the port that you need to go to. So for the above   example it would be `127.0.0.1:3000
    - Create DockerHub public repo  
        - process to create   
          - Create account then navigate to repo menu then select new repo and create while making sure you have selected public     
    - Configure GitHub Secrets
